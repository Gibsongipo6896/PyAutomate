# PyAutomate

A lightweight Python automation demo for Windows OS, designed to showcase simple task automation. To test, make sure to wait for the 'bye' message to ensure the automation has completed. The script uses mostly built-in libraries like subprocess, threading, and time, with pyautogui as the only external dependency. Stay tuned for more advanced and large-scale projects coming soon!
